## Description
Dialogue is a chat application suited for the Model UN conference environment. With the ongoing shift towards online conferences, the traditional format of in-person note-passing is no longer a suitable option.

A popular alternative is to utilize a Google Form to gather notes that delegates hope to send. However, the designated note-passer in committee is saddled with a large workload of copy-and-pasting messages into the Zoom chat, constantly needing to toggle between different message recipients.

With **_Dialogue_**, moderators within committee can simply preview each message, confirm its appropriate nature with the click of the button, and the message will travel to its recipient. Moderators no longer need to toggle between different chat boxes, and for delegates, the flow rate of conversation is increased, and the continuity of conversations is better preserved.
